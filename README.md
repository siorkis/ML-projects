# Simple ML projects
Here you can find 3 ML-based projects aiming to learn how to visualize data, process data, build NN models using Tensorflow, and tries to improve model performance by adding regularization techniques and data augmentation. 
Inside those folders, you can find .ipnb files which could be imported into Google Colab, where you can find all explanations. 

## In short:

- Admission prediction for students
This model predicts the chance of admission of students based on their results during studies.

- Image processing
Passport photo detection with **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs) VS Passport photo detection with **OpenCV**.

- Detecting danerous job offers
Based on the job offer's text, the model could predict whether this offer most likely will be safe or dangerous.
